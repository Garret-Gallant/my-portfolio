      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey, my name is Garret Gallant!</p>
      <p>
        Given my resume is embedded, I will keep this more casual, and about the things I do aside from coding!
        I love skating, and I've been a musician since I was 13 years old. 
      <p>
        I began expanding my instruments around 
        the age of 16 when I found guitar wasn't able to make songs all by itself very well, and learned drums, keyboard, 
        and audio production as well. Since then I've been making tons of music, and drawing parallels between different 
        programming languages and how different instruments are played has been profoundly interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of music I've been a skater and BMX Rider for quite a few years, and it's the main reason I can get away from my desk. 
        The dedication and drive I've built from extreme sports has certainly carried over to programming and I find the same
        habits I employ when learning a new trick on a skateboard have led to a keen ability to learn new programming 
        concepts quickly.
